 * Http responses can be large and they are only needed when the corresponding http.http.android request matched. So we don't need and

 * This proxy knows how to fetch and build the http.http.android response but does not necessary keep it in memory. It can fetch the
 * response lazily.
 * <p/>
 * It also keeps track if the response has already been consumed or not. In that way we can support different responses for
 * same request and we can check if we have the exact amount of expected calls for a request.
